## Preferred contributions

At the moment, these kind of contributions are more appreciated and should be preferred:

- Fix for issues described in [Known Issues](./README.md#known-issues)
- New traslators: for further details see [Implement Translators](#implement-translators)
- Improvements to translators: any improvement to transliteration is accepted if makes sense, consider that my implementations could be not 100% correct (and probably they're not), indeed consider that I don't speak all these languages (tbh I only can speak Russian as a language with a different alphabet from latin - and I can't even speak it very well).
- Code optimizations: any optimization to the code is welcome

For any other kind of contribution, especially for new features, please submit an issue first.

## Pull Request Process

Let's make it simple and clear:

1. Write your code.
2. Write a **properly documentation** following **rustdoc** standard.
3. Write tests for your code. **Code coverage for your code must be at least at 90%**.
4. Report changes to the issue you opened.
5. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new line in the changelog, new modules if added, new command line options if added, etc.
6. Request maintainers to merge your changes.

## Developer contributions guide

Welcome to the contributions guide for Pyc. This chapter DOESN'T contain the documentation for Pyc, which can instead be found on Rust Docs at <https://docs.rs/pyc>
This chapter describes how Pyc works and the guide lines to implement stuff such as translators or prompt modules.

### How Pyc Works

### Implement Translators

### Implement Prompt Modules

### Test your module
