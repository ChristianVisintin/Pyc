## Introduction

Lev text editor is the built-in text editor in Pyc-shell. Pratically is a program inside another program. It has its option parser, it receives its arguments, etc...
The reason Lev is necessary for Pyc, is the fact that Pyc as it is implemented, doesn't allow you to use a traditional text editor, such as vim, nano or emacs.
Lev text editor is designed to provide something in between vim and nano; so not too simple, but not even too complex. It supports in my opinion anything you need in a terminal text editor.

And if you ask, yes, Lev because of Tolst√≤j.
