## About Рус

Pyc is a simple CLI application, written in Rust, which allows you to perform shell commands in russian cyrillic, through command and output transliteration.

### The reasons

Well, basically I started studying russian and to become practical with the cyrillic alphabet a started to use it for even when I was writing in my own language, but I couldn’t use it at work on the shell, so I thought it would have been funny to create Pyc.

## Features

- Transliteration of every word according into russian cyrillic [GOST 7.79-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOST_7.79-2000) with some differences ([See here](#cyrillic-to-latin))
- Possibility to implement new translators for other cyrillic alphabets.
- Conversion of both Input and outputs.
- Escaping for latin strings.
- Oneshot and shell modes
- Customizations and aliases

## Usage

TODO

## Configuration

Pyc supports a user configuration which adds some features and customization.
The configuration must be stored at ```$HOME/.config/pyc/pyc.yml```. A default configuration is located in the repository at ```/pyc.yml```.

Let's see how the configuration is written

```yaml
alias:
  - чд: "cd"
  - пвд: "pwd"
  - уич: "which"
output:
  translate: true
```

- alias (or аляс): list of alias. When the first word of a command is one of the configured alias, it is automatically replaced with the associated latin expression.
- output (or оутпут): output configuration
  - translate (or транслатэ): indicates to pyc whether the output has to be converted to cyrillic or not

## Documentation

These are the documents related to Pyc documentation:

## Known issues

### Unicode Replacement character while typing (�)

If you see this character ```�``` when you're typing cyrillic characters, these steps may fix the problem:

Reconfigure locales:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Select all the locales you need from the list, but most important select **ru_RU.UTF-8**.

Regenerate locales:

```sh
sudo locale-gen
```

### Cd command in oneshot mode doesn't work

Yep. Unfortunately it seems there's no way to make it work in oneshot mode.
If you know a possible way to make it work, please contribute to this project to implement it.
