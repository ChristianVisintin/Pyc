## About Рус

Pyc is a simple CLI application, written in Rust, which allows you to perform shell commands in russian cyrillic, through command and output transliteration.

### The reasons

Well, basically I started studying russian and to become practical with the cyrillic alphabet a started to use it for even when I was writing in my own language, but I couldn’t use it at work on the shell, so I thought it would have been funny to create Pyc.

## Features

- Transliteration of every word according into russian cyrillic [GOST 7.79-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOST_7.79-2000) with some differences ([See here](#cyrillic-to-latin))
- Possibility to implement new translators for other cyrillic alphabets.
- Conversion of both Input and outputs.
- Escaping for latin strings.
- Oneshot and shell modes
- Customizations and aliases

## Usage

TODO

## Configuration

Pyc supports a user configuration which adds some features and customization.
The configuration must be stored at ```$HOME/.config/pyc/pyc.yml```. A default configuration is located in the repository at ```/pyc.yml```.

Let's see how the configuration is written

```yaml
language: ru
alias:
  - чд: cd
  - пвд: pwd
  - уич: which
output:
  translate: true
prompt:
  prompt_line: "${USER} on ${HOSTNAME} in ${WRKDIR} ${GIT_BRANCH} ${GIT_COMMIT} ${CMD_TIME}"
  history_size: 256
  translate: false
  break:
    enabled: true
    with: "❯"
  duration:
    min_elapsed_time: 2000
  rc:
    ok: "✔"
    error: "✖"
  git:
    branch: "on  "
    commit_ref_len: 8
```

- alias: list of alias. When the first word of a command is one of the configured alias, it is automatically replaced with the associated latin expression.
- language: Pyc default language (can be overridden with cli options)
- output: output configuration
  - translate: indicates to pyc whether the output has to be converted to cyrillic or not
- prompt: Prompt configuration (See [Prompt Configuration](#prompt-line-configuration))
  - prompt_line: String describing the prompt line syntax
  - history_size: Pyc history size
  - translate: should the prompt line be translated
  - break: Break line after prompt
    - enabled: should the prompt break or not?
  - duration: command duration configuration
    - enabled: module enabled
    - with: break with provided string
  - rc: return code module
    - ok: string to write in case of successful command
    - error: string to write in case of error
  - git: git module
    - branch: string to write before writing branch name
    - commit_ref_len: length of commit reference

### Prompt Line Configuration

The prompt configuration is used to setup the prompt line when using the interactive mode.
The prompt configuration provides parameters to customize the line printed when interacting with the shell.
In addition to the parameters described before, here the prompt line keys are illustrated.

Each prompt line key must have the following syntax ```${VAR_NAME}```

**General** keys

## Known issues

### Unicode Replacement character while typing (�)

If you see this character ```�``` when you're typing cyrillic characters, these steps may fix the problem:

Reconfigure locales:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
```

Select all the locales you need from the list, but most important select **ru_RU.UTF-8**.

Regenerate locales:

```sh
sudo locale-gen
```

If this didn't solve your problem it's probably an issue of your terminal. Up to now I've found out that some terminals just don't let you type non-ascii characters when executing an application. These are the terminals which I've used or have been reported which **DON'T** work.

- Windows Terminal

### Cd command in oneshot mode doesn't work

Yep. Unfortunately it seems there's no way to make it work in oneshot mode.
If you know a possible way to make it work, please contribute to this project to implement it.
