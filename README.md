## About Рус

Pyc is a simple CLI application, written in Rust, which allows you to perform shell commands in russian cyrillic, through command and output transliteration.

### The reasons

Well, basically I started studying russian and to become practical with the cyrillic alphabet a started to use it for even when I was writing in my own language, but I couldn’t use it at work on the shell, so I thought it would have been funny to create Pyc.

## Features

- Transliteration of every word according to russian [GOST 7.79-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOST_7.79-2000) with some differences ([See here](#cyrillic-to-latin))
- Conversion of both Input and outputs.
- Escaping for latin strings.
- Oneshot and interactive modes
- Customizations for interactive mode and aliases

## Usage

TODO

## Configuration

Pyc supports a user configuration which adds some features and customization.
The configuration must be stored at ```$HOME/.config/pyc/pyc.yml```. A default configuration is located in the repository at ```/pyc.yml```.

Let's see how the configuration is written

```yaml
аляс:
  - чд: "cd"
  - пвд: "pwd"
  - уич: "which"
```

- аляс (or alias): list of alias. When the first word of a command is one of the configured alias, it is automatically replaced with the associated latin expression.

### Cyrillic to latin

The conversion from cyrillic to latin follows the [GOST 7.79-2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOST_7.79-2000) standard with some differences. The entire conversion table is illustrated here below:

| Russian | Latin | Notes                                                                                                                                                  |

| К       | C     | K is translated into C, only when not followed ```'Е','Э','И','Й','Ы','ъ'```, or it is preceeded by ```'К','А','И','О'```. You can force a 'C' using ```'Кь'```  |
